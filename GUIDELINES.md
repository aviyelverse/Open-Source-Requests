Aviyel is on a mission to help Open Source projects sustain by building communities around them and incentivizing contributors. We are placing gigs on this repository so that members of the community who are already familiar with the projects may take them up and get to work.

### Before we begin, there are a few things to consider.

- We are just publishing these gigs to make them more segregated and accessible.
- Please check that an issue is open for contributions before picking it up.
- And, before you pick up an issue, please create comment on the specific issue in the issue tabs so we can assign to you and keep track of it's availability.
