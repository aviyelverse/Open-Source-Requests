The Request Board has a curation of contribution opportunities that members of the community may attempt.

### Before you begin, there are a few things we would want to bring to your notice

- We, at Aviyel, are responsible only for curating the requests. Any payment related to a request completion should be handled directly between the request owner and contributor.
- Please check the status of an issue before you start working on it.
- To be a part of the discussions related to the requests, join [Aviyel's discord server](https://discord.com/invite/7DCwyYGSst).

1. Click on the .md file associated to a project.

For code issues, we would recommend you to get the issue assigned to you on both the Open-Source-Requests and the original project repositories, before you start working on it. For non-code issues, please get the issue on Open-Source-Requests assigned to you and also make sure you contact the request owner as mentioned in the issue link.
